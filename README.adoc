=== Style Customization

Pretty SVN Index supports customizing its style via variables.
To do so, go to directory `src/scss/` and add a new file named `pretty-svn-index-customized.scss` and load the `pretty-svn-index` module into it:

.src/scss/pretty-svn-index-customized.scss (example)
[code,scss]
----
@use "pretty-svn-index" with (
  $title-background-color: #44a100,
  $title-text-color: rgba(0,28,87,0.9),
);
----

The following table lists all available variables and their type:

== Acknowledgments

Pretty SVN Index wouldn't be half as good without the beautiful http://www.latofonts.com[Lato font ^]family^, and the awesome icon set https://fontawesome.com[Font Awesome^].
The styling works would also have been much less enjoyable if it wasn't for the great https://sass-lang.com[Sass CSS extension language^].
